# Day 1 - Networking

## Key terms (my own words)
- IP address: address of a device on a network
- DNS: converts a domain name to an IP
- Port: a number that identifies a service (example 80/443/22)
- TCP: reliable, connection-based
- UDP: faster, connectionless
- HTTP vs HTTPS: HTTPS is HTTP + encryption (TLS)
- Router vs Switch: router connects networks, switch connects devices in same network
